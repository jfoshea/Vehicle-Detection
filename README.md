# Vehicle Detection 

## Overview
A self driving car needs to be able to navigate a road using computer vision.  In this project we develop a vehicle detection system. Many aspects of OpenCV, python, numpy, and matplotlib are used to develop the vehicle detection system. The jupyter notebook can be found here  [VehicleDetection.ipynb](https://github.com/jfoshea/VehicleDetection/blob/master/VehicleDetection.ipynb)

## Installing and Running the Pipeline
The following steps are used to run the pipeline:
1. Install jupyter notebook environment and packages
    ```
    https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/doc/configure_via_anaconda.md
    ```
2. Clone the Vehicle Dectection  git repository
    ```  
    $  git clone https://github.com/jfoshea/VehicleDetection.git
    ```

3. enable cardnd-term1 virtualenv
    ```
    $ source activate carnd-term1
    ```
4. Run the Pipeline 
    ```
    $ jupyter notebook VehicleDetection.ipynb
    ```
